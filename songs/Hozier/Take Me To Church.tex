 \beginverse
  \[Em] My lover's got \[Am]humo\[Em]r, she's the giggle at a \[Am]fune\[G]ral
  Knows everybody's disappr\[Am]oval\[Em], I should've worshipped her s\[Am]oone\[Em]r
  If the Heavens ever \[Am]did speak\[Em], sheâ€™s the last true m\[Am]outhpiece\[G]
  Every Sunday's getting m\[Am]ore blea\[Em]k, a fresh poison e\[Am]ach week\[D]
  We were born sick,\[C] you heard them say it
  \[Em] My church offers no \[Am]absolute\[Em]s, she tells me 'worship in the \[Am]bedroom'\[G]
  The only heaven I'll be \[Am]sent t\[Em]o is when I'm alone w\[Am]ith you\[D]
  I was born sick\[C], but I love it. Command me to be well
  A-A-A-A-\[G]A-  \[C]Am\[G]en \[Cm]Ame\[G]n \[Cm]Ame\[G]n

  \[(E)--3-2--] \[2-1]Take me to ch\[Em]urch I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your li\[B7]es
  I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your kn\[G]ife
  Offer me that d\[Am]eathless death, good G\[Em]od, let me give you my \[**]life\[(E)--5-3--3-2--]

 \beginverse
  \[Em] If I'm a pagan of the g\[Am]ood time\[Em]s, my lover's the \[Am]sunlight\[G]
  To keep the Goddess on \[Am]my sid\[Em]e she demands a sac\[Am]rifice\[D]
  Drain the whole sea\[C], get something shiny
  \[Em] Something meaty for the \[Am]main cours\[Em]e, that's a fine looking \[Am]high horse\[G]
  What you got in the s\[Am]table\[Em]? We've a lot of starving f\[Am]aithful\[D]
  That looks tasty,\[C] that looks plenty, this is hungry work

  \[C] No masters\[G] or kings when the \[B7]ritual beg\[Em]ins
  There is n\[C]o sweeter \[G]innocence than \[B7]our gentle \[Em]sin
  In the m\[C]adness and s\[G]oil of that \[B7]sad earthly sc\[Em]ene
  Only th\[C]en I am h\[G]uman, only th\[B7]en I am cl\[Em]ean  \[D]   O\[G/B]h\[C]
