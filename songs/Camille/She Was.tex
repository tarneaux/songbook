 \beginverse
  When she was \[Am]home she was a swan
  When she was \[F]out she was a tiger
  And a \[Dm]tiger in the wild is not \[E7]tied to anyone
  When she was \[Am]lost, she was a toad
  The day I \[F]found her on the road
  I gave her \[Dm]water and a rose
  And as she \[E7]stretched
  The sun rose
 \endverse

 \beginchorus
  \[Am]Go,    \[F]go,    \[Dm]go
  Go \[E7]away, go away, go away
  \[Am]Go,    \[F]go,    \[Dm]go
  Go \[E7]away, go away
 \endchorus

 \beginverse
  When she was \[Am]young
  She was a cow
  And all day \[F]long
  She milked the stars
  She \[Dm]taught me "Women to survive
  Must be un\[E7]faithful to their child"
  Of all the \[Am]wonders of the world
  She was a \[F]lady with a bird
  She must have \[Dm]had so many lives
  Was it the \[E7]first?
  Was it the last?
 \endverse

 \beginchorus
  \[Am]Go, \[F]go, \[Dm]go
  Go \[E7]away, go away, go away
  \[Am]Go, \[F]go, \[Dm]go
  Go \[E7]away, go away
 \endchorus

 \beginverse
  When she was \[Am]ill she was a whale
  She was so \[F]patient, she would wait
  Until I \[Dm]sang her by the lane
  The sweetest \[E7]tunes to ease her pain
  When she was \[Am]old she was an owl
  I saw her \[F]swaying in the sky
  And when she \[Dm]died inside my arms
  I rea\[E7]lised she was a cat
 \endverse

 \beginchorus
  \[Am]Go, \[F]go, \[Dm]go

 \beginverse
  Sometimes I \[Am]wonder (go)
  If my \[F]child (go)
  Will have her \[Dm]eyes (go)
  (\[E7]Go away, go away)
  To see t\[Am]hrough me (go)
  And when I \[F]die (go)
  And I am \[Dm]born again (go)
  (\[E7]Go away, go away)
  What will I\[Am] be (go)
  A \[F]stone? (go)
  A \[Dm]cat? (go)
  A\[E7] tree? (Go away, go away)
 \endverse

 \beginchorus
  \[Am]Go, \[F]go, \[Dm]go
