 \beginverse
   When you get \[Am]older, plainer, saner
  Will you reme\[D]mber all the danger we came fr\[Em]om
  Burning like \[Am]embers, falling, tender
  Longing for the \[D]days of no surrender
  Years a\[Em]go and \[Em]well you know
 \endverse

 \beginverse
  \[Am]Smoke 'em if you got them 'cause it's \[D]going down
  \[Em]All I ever wanted was you I'll \[Am]never get to heaven
  'Cause I \[D]don't know how, let's \[Em]raise a glass or two
 \endverse

 \beginchorus
  To \[C]all \[C/B]the things I \[Am]lost on you, oh, \[D]oh
  Tell me are they \[Em]lost on you? Oh, \[C]oh
  Just that \[C/B]you could \[Am]cut me loose, oh, \[D]oh
  After everything I've l\[Em]ost on you
  Is that \[C]lost on you?\[C/B] Ooo\[Am]ooh o\[D]ooh oo\[Em]oooh
  Is that \[C]lost on you?\[C/B] Ooo\[Am]ooh o\[D]ooh
  Baby is that \[Em]lost on you? Is that \[C]lost on you?
 \endchorus

 \beginverse
  Wishing I could \[Am]see the machinations
  Understand the \[D]toil of expectations in your \[Em]mind
  Hold me like you \[Am]never lost your patience
  Tell me that you l\[D]ove me more than hate me all the time \[Em]
  \[Em]And you're still mine
 \endverse

 \beginverse
  So \[Am]smoke 'em if you've got 'em, 'cause it's \[D]going down
  A\[Em]ll I ever wanted was you, let's t\[Am]ake a drink of heaven
  This can \[D]turn around, let's \[Em]raise a glass or two
