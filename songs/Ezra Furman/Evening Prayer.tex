\beginsong{Evening Prayer}[by={Ezra Furman}]

 \beginverse
  \[Bb]I wasted my twenties in submission
  \[Bb]I thought I was outside the system
  \[Bb]But I was rolling over for wealth and power
  As if \[Eb]they really cared about \[F]me
  The \[Bb]kids are just getting started
  They've only just learned how to howl
  And most of them throw in the towel
  \[Eb]'Bout the time that they turn twenty-\[F]three
  If \[Gm]you've got the taste for trans\[Dm]cendence
  That \[Gm]translates your love into \[Dm]action
  And \[Gm]participate in the \[Dm]fight now
  For a \[Eb]creed you can truly be\[F]lieve
 \endverse

 \beginchorus
  It is \[Bb]time for the \[F]evening \[Bb]prayer\[Eb]
  Time to \[Gm]do justice \[F]for the \[Gm]poor\[Eb]
  It is \[Bb]time for the \[F]evening \[Bb]prayer\[Eb]
  \[Gm]Time to do justice \[F]for the \[Eb]poor

 \beginverse
  To\[Bb]night you've got fire in your bloodstream
  \[Bb]If your frail human heart is still pumping
  \[Bb]Then make this one night you'll remember
  \[Eb]A note you deliver by \[F]hand
  And \[Bb]when you get up in the morning
  Let no man return it to sender
  And \[Gm]pour gasoline on the \[Dm]embers
  \[Gm]Keep yourself a physical \[Dm]record
  Del\[Gm]iver that fire to the \[Dm]real world
  And \[Eb]tell 'em that E Furman \[F]sent ya
