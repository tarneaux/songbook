 \beginverse
  It's the \[G]search for a church in the \[Am7]bottom of your purse
  A \[D]spiritual home which you can \[C]take to the mall
  You \[G]dig and you dig but you can \[Am7]only find your wallet
  And your \[Bm*]phone with a h\[Am7*]undred missed \[C]calls
  You could \[Em*]never re\[D*]turn them \[C]all
   | G | % | 
 \endverse

 \beginverse
  And I \[G]watch you with your purse from the a\[Am7]djacent coffee table
  At the \[D]Starbucks they built inside \[C]my heart
  And your \[G]make-up starts to run, you can \[Am7]see you're getting older
  You can \[Bm*]see your l\[Am7*]ife has been \[C]hard
  Your face is \[Em*]worn like an \[D*]old playing \[C]card
  The Queen of \[G]Hearts
  The Queen of \[Am7]Hearts

 \beginverse
  I am \[G]working in my bedroom, I'm com\[Am7]posing all the music
  For a \[D]film that will never be \[C]made
  It's the \[G]story of my life, a one \[Am7]million hour epic
  About a \[Bm*]good man who \[Am7*]went down in \[C]flames
  Who got \[Em*]lost in God's \[D*]multitude of \[C]names
   | G | % | 
 \endverse

 \beginverse
  I am \[G]searching, I am searching I am \[Am7]waving my antenna
  Trying to \[D]pick up some signal through this \[C]dream
  I'm an \[G]ant in a hill but I \[Am7]think and I feel
  And I'm co\[Bm*]mposing these love \[Am7*]letters to the \[C]queen
  Hoping s\[Em*]omebody will \[D*]see what I \[C]mean
  The Queen of \[G]Hearts
  The Queen of \[Am7]Hearts
  The Qu\[G]een of \[Am7]Hearts
 \endverse

 \beginverse
  I always \[G]heard about God with a \[Am7]wink and a nod
  I guess I \[D]took it all too seriou\[C]sly
  But I was \[G]five years old and I \[Am7]took what I was told
  To \[Bm*]mean that the \[Am7*]sublime was in my \[C]reach
  That the \[Em*]ocean of the k\[D*]nown ends at the \[C]beach
  Just up the \[G]street
   | G | % | 
 \endverse

 \beginverse
  These \[G]days people like that are con\[Am7]sidered aberrations
  And I'm \[D]being corrected as we \[C]speak
  This is my \[G]heart, it's a motor, it will \[Am7]search the world over
  I'm a \[Bm*]search engine, \[Am7*]see what I \[C]mean?
  I don't \[Em*]need the Intern\[D*]et, I don't need T\[C]V
  To find the \[G]queen
  The Queen of \[Am7]Hearts
  The Q\[G]ueen
 \endverse

 \beginverse
  So if you \[G*]ever find that church that f\[Am7*]its in your purse
  Put it \[D*]into your cold metal shopping \[C*]cart
  And keep on \[G]wandering the aisles on the \[Am7]sick fluorescent tiles
  We'll be \[Bm*]miles and \[Am7*]miles apa\[C]rt
  I've got my \[Em*]own search, I'm s\[D*]till just at the \[C]start
  I'll be \[Em*]out on the \[D*]highways looking \[C]for my counterpart
  The \[G]Queen of \[Am7]Hearts
