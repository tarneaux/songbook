  \[C#m]I'm still here in this \[A]bed that I crawled in\[E]
  \[C#m]I hope that I'm someone \[A]else in the morning\[E]
  \[C#m]So take this one, \[A]wash it down and you'll be fine(\[E]-ine)
  \[C#m]Then walk around in a \[A]floating chalk outline\[E]

 \beginverse
  But sooooo it\[F#m] gooooo\[A]es, let it \[E]be
  In the ga\[F#m]llows I balanced
  On my \[A]toes so I can \[B]breathe
 \endverse

 \beginchorus
  But little by \[A]little, bit by bit\[E]
  I push it back \[B]down with a new ha\[C#m]bit
  If not for \[A]long, just for a while\[E]
  I'll bury my\[B]self with a great big \[C#m]smile
  Oh my \[A]my, oh my \[E]my
  We trace our \[B]selves in these chalk out\[C#m]lines
  Oh my \[A]my, oh my \[N.C.]my
  Erase ourselves in these chalk outlines
 \endchorus

 \beginverse
  \[C#m]Sertraline and a \[A]sip of serotonin\[E]
  \[C#m]Don't cry 'cause \[A]there's a pill for everything\[E]

 \beginverse
  \[A]It's such a perfect \[C#m]day
  Take it just in \[B]case, take it just in \[A]case
  \[A]I'm scared of being \[C#m]okay
  'Cause all things \[B]change, all things \[A]change
  \[A]It's such a perfect \[C#m]day
  It's a beautiful \[B]shame, it's a beautiful \[C#m]shame

 \beginchorus
  \textnote{(A cappella)}
  But little by little, bit by bit
  I push it back down with a new habit
  If not for long, just for a while
  I'll bury myself with a great big smile
  Oh my \[A]my, oh my \[E]my
  We trace our \[B]selves in these chalk out\[C#m]lines
  Oh my \[A]my, oh my \[N.C.]my
  Erase ourselves in these chalk outlines
