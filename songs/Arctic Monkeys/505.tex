 \beginchorus
  I'm going b\[Dm]ack to 505 If it's a \[Em]7 hour flight
  Or a fort\[Dm]y-five minute drive
  In \[Em]my imagination you're waiting l\[Dm]ying on your side
  With your h\[Em]ands between your thighs\[Dm] \[Em]
 \endchorus

 \beginverse
  \[Dm]Stop and wait a sec when you \[Em]look at me like that
  My darling \[Dm]what did you expect? I \[Em]probably still adore you
  With your \[Dm]hands around my neck or I d\[Em]id last time I checked

 \beginverse
  \[Dm]Not shy of a spark
  The \[Em]knife twists at the thought that I should \[Dm]fall short of the mark
  \[Em]Frightened by the bite though it's no \[Dm]harsher than the bark
  The m\[Em]iddle of adventure is such a \[Dm]perfect place to start\[Em]

  [Verse 3] (Faster strumming)
  But I crumble comp\[Dm*]letely when you cry
  It s\[Em*]eems like once again you've had to g\[Dm*]reet me with goodbye
  I'm a\[Em*]lways just about to go and \[Dm*]spoil the surprise
  Take my h\[Em*]ands off of your eyes too soon\[Dm*] \[Em*]
