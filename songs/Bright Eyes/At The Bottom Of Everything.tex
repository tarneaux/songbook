 \beginverse
  we must \[C]talk on every telephone get \[F]eaten off the \[C]web
  we must \[C]rip out all the epilogues from the \[F]books that we have \[G]read
  and in the \[C]face of every criminal strapped \[F]firmly to a chair
  we must \[C]stare, we must \[G]stare, we must \[C]stare
  we must \[C]take all of the medicine too ex\[F]pensive now to \[C]sell
  set \[C]fire to the preacher who is \[F]promising us \[G]hell
  and in the \[C]ear of every anarchist that \[F]sleeps but doesn't dream
  we must \[C]sing, we must \[G]sing, we must \[C]sing,   it'll go like this alright
 \endverse

 \beginverse
  \[F]While my mother \[G]waters plants my \[C]father loads his \[F]gun
  he say \[F]death will give us \[G]back to god, just \[Am]like the setting s\[F]un
  is \[G]returned to the lonesome ocean

 \beginverse
  we must \[C]blend into the choir sing as \[F]static with the \[C]whole
  we must \[C]memorize nine numbers and de\[F]ny we have a \[G]soul
  and in this \[C]endless race for property and \[F]privilege to be won
  we must \[C]run, we must \[G]run, we must \[C]run
  we must \[C]hang up in the belfry where the \[F]bats and moonlight \[C]laugh
  we must \[C]stare into a crystal ball and \[F]only see the pa\[G]st
  and in the \[C]caverns of tomorrow with just our \[F]flashlight and our love
  we must \[C]plunge, we must \[G]plunge, we must \[C]plunge
 \endverse

 \beginverse

  And then we'll get down \[C]there, way down to the very bottom of \[C]everything
  And then we'll see it,\[C] oh we'll see it, we'll see it, we'll see it
 \endverse

 \beginverse
  \[F]oh my morning's \[G]coming back the \[C]whole world's waking \[F]up
  all the \[F]city buses \[G]swimming past I'm \[Am]happy just be\[F]cause
  I \[G]found out I am really no one
