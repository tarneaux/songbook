 \capo{3}

 \beginverse
  if \[C]you walk away i\[G]'ll walk away \[C]
  first t\[C]ell me which r\[G]oad you will t\[C]ake
  \[Am]i don't want to r\[G]isk our paths cr\[C]ossing some d\[Am]ay
  so \[C]you walk that way, i'\[G]ll walk this way \[C]
 \endverse

 \beginverse
  and the future hangs over our heads
  and it moves with each current event
  until it falls all around like a cold, steady rain
  just stay in when it's looking this way
 \endverse

 \beginverse
  and the moons laying low in the sky
  forcing everything metal to shine
  and the sidewalk holds diamonds
  like the jewelry store case
  you walk that way, i'll walk this way
 \endverse

 \beginverse
  and laura's asleep in my bed
  as i'm leaving she wakes up and says
  i dreamed you were carried away
  on the crest of a wave
  baby don't go away, come here
 \endverse

 \beginverse
  and there's kids playing guns in the street
  and one's pointing his tree branch at me
  so i put my hands up
  i say enough is enough
  \[C]if you walk away i\[G]'ll walk a\[C]way
  and h\[C7]e shot me dead
 \endverse

 \beginchorus
  \[Am]  i found a l\[G]iquid c\[C]ure    \[Am]  for my lan\[G]dlocked b\[C]lues
  it will p\[F]ass a\[G]way like a s\[C]low p\[Am]arade
  it's lea\[C]ving but i do\[G]n't know how s\[C]oon
 \endchorus

 \beginverse
  and the world's got me dizzy again
  you'd think after 22 years i'd be used to the spin
  and it only feels worse when i stay in one place
  so i'm always pacing around or walking away
 \endverse

 \beginverse
  i keep drinking the ink from my pen
  and i'm balancing history books up on my head
  but it all boils down to one quotable phrase
  if you love something give it away
 \endverse

 \beginverse
  a good woman will pick you apart
  a box full of suggestions for your possible heart
  but you may be offended and you may be afraid
  but don't walk away, don't walk away
 \endverse

 \beginverse
  we made love on the living room floor
  with the noise in the background from the televised war
  and in the deafening pleasure
  i thought i heard someone say
  if we walk away they'll walk away
 \endverse

 \beginverse
  but greed is a bottomless pit
  and our freedom's a joke we're just taking a piss
  and the whole world must watch the sad comic display
  if you're still free start running away
  cause we're coming for you
 \endverse

 \beginverse
  i've grown tired of holding this pose
  i feel more like a stranger each time i come home
  so i'm making a deal with the devils of fame
  saying let me walk away, please
 \endverse

 \beginverse
  you'll be free, child, once you have died
  from the shackles of language and measurable time
  and then we can trade places, play musical grace
  till then walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away
 \endverse

 \beginverse
  \[Am] so i'm \[G]out that d\[C]oor
  \[Am] putting \[G]on my sh\[C]oes
  i just w\[F]ant to m\[G]ake
  a c\[C]lean es\[Am]cape
  i'm lea\[C]ving but i \[G]don't know where t\[C]o
  i'm lea\[C]ving but i \[G]don't know where t\[C]o
