  \[A]Poison oak, some boyhood brave\[Dsus2]ry
  When th\[A]e telephone was a tin can on a st\[Dsus2]ring
  And I\[F#m] fell asleep with you still talking to me\[E]
  You said you weren't af\[A]raid to die\[Dsus2]

  In p\[A]olaroids you were dressed in women's clo\[Dsus2]thes
  Were you\[A] made ashamed, why'd you lock them in the dr\[Dsus2]awer?
  Wel\[F#m]l I don't think that I ever loved you m\[E]ore
 \endverse \fi

 \beginchorus
  Than when you tu\[A]rned away
  When you sla\[Dsus2]mmed the door
  When you s\[F#m]tole a car drove, towards Mex\[E]ico
  And you wr\[A]ote bad checks just to f\[Dsus2]ill your arm
  I was y\[F#m]oung enough, I still bel\[E]ieved in war

 \beginverse
  \[E]But let the poets cry themselves to s\[F#m]leep
  \[E]And all their tearful words would turn back into s\[F#m]team
  But me, I'm a s\[A]ingle cell on a s\[Dsus2]erpent's tongue
  And there's a m\[F#m]uddy field where a gar\[E]den was
  And I'm glad you \[A]got away
  But I'm still st\[Dsus2]uck out here
  My clothes are s\[F#m]oaking wet from your br\[E]other's tears

 \beginverse
  \[E]And I never thought this life was possib\[F#m]le
  \[E]You're the yellow bird that I've been waiting fo\[F#m]r
  The end of par\[A]alysis I was a st\[Dsus2]atuette
  Now I'm dr\[F#m]unk as hell on a pian\[E]o bench
  And when I p\[A]ress the keys it all g\[Dsus2]ets reversed
  The sound of l\[F#m]oneliness makes me \[E]happier
