 \beginverse
  I \[C]heard there was a \[Am]secret chord
  That \[C]David played and it \[Am]pleased the Lord
  But \[F]you don't really \[G]care for music, \[C]do you?\[G]
  Well it \[C]goes like this the \[F]fourth, the \[G]fifth
  The \[Am]minor fall and the \[F]major lift
  The \[G]baffled king \[E7]composing halle\[Am]lujah
 \endverse

 \beginchorus
  Halle\[F]lujah, halle\[Am]lujah, halle\[F]lujah, halle\[C]lu-u-\[G]u-u-\[C]jah ...\[Am].\[C] \[Am]
 \endchorus

 \beginverse
  Well, your \[C]faith was strong but you \[Am]needed proof
  You \[C]saw her bathing \[Am]on the roof
  Her \[F]beauty and the \[G]moonlight over\[C]threw you\[G]
  She \[C]tied you to her \[F]kitchen \[G]chair
  She \[Am]broke your throne and she \[F]cut your hair
  And \[G]from your lips she \[E7]drew the halle\[Am]lujah
 \endverse

 \beginchorus
  Halle\[F]lujah, halle\[Am]lujah, halle\[F]lujah, halle\[C]lu-u-\[G]u-u-\[C]jah ...\[Am].\[C] \[Am]
 \endchorus

 \beginverse
  \[C]Baby, I've been \[Am]here before
  I've \[C]seen this room and I've \[Am]walked this floor
  I \[F]used to live a\[G]lone before I \[C]knew you\[G]
  I've \[C]seen your flag on the \[F]marble \[G]arch
  But \[Am]love is not a vic\[F]tory march
  It's a \[G]cold and it's a \[E7]broken halle\[Am]lujah
 \endverse

 \beginchorus
  Halle\[F]lujah, halle\[Am]lujah, halle\[F]lujah, halle\[C]lu-u-\[G]u-u-\[C]jah ...\[Am].\[C] \[Am]
 \endchorus

 \beginverse
  Well, there \[C]was a time when you \[Am]let me know
  What's \[C]really going \[Am]on below
  But \[F]now you never \[G]show that to me \[C]do you\[G]
  But re\[C]member when I \[F]moved in \[G]you
  And the \[Am]holy dove was \[F]moving too
  And \[G]every breath we \[E7]drew was halle\[Am]lujah
 \endverse

 \beginchorus
  Halle\[F]lujah, halle\[Am]lujah, halle\[F]lujah, halle\[C]lu-u-\[G]u-u-\[C]jah ...\[Am].\[C] \[Am]
 \endchorus

 \beginverse
  Well, \[C]maybe there's a \[Am]God above
  But \[C]all I've ever \[Am]learned from love
  Was \[F]how to shoot some\[G]body who out\[C]drew you\[G]
  It's \[C]not a cry that you \[F]hear at \[G]night
  It's \[Am]not somebody who's \[F]seen the light
  It's a \[G]cold and it's a \[E7]broken halle\[Am]lujah
